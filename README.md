# A Comprehensive Guide to 🚀 Cursor AI 🚀

Welcome to this personal collection of best practices, rules, and workflows designed to maximize your productivity with Cursor. This framework aims to help everyone, from Product Managers to Developers, harness the full potential of AI-assisted coding and documentation.

**💡 Pro Tip for Everyone (Especially Non-Developers):** One of the most impactful ways to boost your productivity with Cursor is through [Markdown-Driven Planning & Brainstorming](./01-Cursor-for-Everyone/08-Markdown-Driven-Planning.md). It's a simple yet powerful technique to manage knowledge and projects, and you'll find it covered in Part 1.

This repository is structured to guide you through understanding core Cursor concepts and then diving into advanced development workflows.

### 💻 Part 2: Cursor for Developers

This section delves into advanced techniques and workflows tailored for developers. It covers topics like building tech-stack specific rules, the `SpecsForge` framework, and efficient implementation strategies. While aimed at developers, Product Managers and technical leads might also find these insights valuable.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1.  Explore **Part 1** to build a solid foundation in Cursor's core functionalities.
2.  If you're a developer, proceed to **Part 2** to learn about my specific coding workflows and the `SpecsForge` framework.
3.  Adapt and adopt what works for you! This is a living guide, and I encourage you to tailor these practices to your own needs.

**Hint:** Interested to see how to have fun with Cursor? Try the [Yolo mode](./01-Cursor-for-Everyone/04-Custom-Modes-Tailoring-Cursor-to-You/04e-Mode-Spotlight-Yolo.md)! Here is what this can result in: [Yolo README](./Yolo-README.md).

## 📜 My Standard Cursor Rules

I recommend always starting with these foundational rules in your `.cursor/rules` directory:

-   [`00-cursor-rules.md`](./.cursor/rules/00-cursor-rules.md): Defines the general structure and guidelines for your cursor rules.
-   [`01-mdc-guidelines.md`](./.cursor/rules/01-mdc-guidelines.md): Provides specific instructions for working with `.mdc` (Markdown Custom) rule files.

Dive into the `.cursor/rules` directory in this repository to find my collection of reusable rules. Feel free to pick and choose what you need!
