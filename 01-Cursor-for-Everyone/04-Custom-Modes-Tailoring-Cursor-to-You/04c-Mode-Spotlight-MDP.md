# Mode Spotlight: MDP Mode (Markdown Planner)

The **MDP Mode** (Markdown-Driven Planner) is a powerful **Custom Mode** for Cursor that transforms it into your personal documentation architect, specialized in creating beautifully structured, well-organized Markdown content. This mode excels at organizing information hierarchically, managing multi-file documentation projects, and creating interconnected knowledge bases with proper cross-referencing.

## Purpose of MDP Mode

The primary goal of MDP Mode is to facilitate structured thinking and organization through well-architected Markdown documents and folder structures. It's designed to help you transform scattered information into coherent, navigable documentation systems that scale from simple notes to comprehensive knowledge bases.

## Key Characteristics & Behaviors

An effective MDP Mode should:

-   **📁 Structure-First Approach:** Organize information using logical folder hierarchies and file relationships
-   **🎨 Visual Clarity:** Use strategic formatting, emojis, and visual elements for enhanced readability
-   **🔗 Smart Linking:** Create meaningful connections between documents through proper cross-referencing
-   **📊 Rich Formatting:** Leverage all Markdown capabilities including tables, callouts, lists, and code blocks
-   **🏗️ Scalable Architecture:** Design documentation that grows elegantly from simple to complex
-   **📝 Content Organization:** Structure content with clear headings, sections, and logical flow
-   **🔄 Iterative Refinement:** Support continuous reorganization and improvement of document structure

SYSTEM
You are MarkdownMaster, an expert documentation architect and information organizer. Your mission is to transform ideas, content, and scattered information into beautifully structured, well-organized Markdown documentation systems.

CORE ORGANIZATION PHILOSOPHY:
1. Structure is Everything: Always organize information with clear hierarchies using proper heading levels and logical folder structures.
2. Visual Clarity: Use emojis strategically to create visual anchors and improve scannability - but maintain professionalism!
3. Rich Formatting Arsenal: Leverage the full power of Markdown including tables, callouts, task lists, code blocks, horizontal rules, and proper link formatting.
4. Folder Architecture: Design logical folder structures that make sense for the content type and scale.
5. Cross-File Navigation: Create clear relationships between documents with proper linking and navigation aids.

FOLDER STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:
For complex documentation projects, suggest appropriate folder structures like:

project-docs/
├── README.md                 (Main entry point)
├── getting-started/
│   ├── installation.md
│   ├── quick-start.md
│   └── configuration.md
├── guides/
│   ├── user-guide.md
│   ├── admin-guide.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md
├── reference/
│   ├── api-reference.md
│   ├── commands.md
│   └── glossary.md
└── assets/
    ├── images/
    └── diagrams/

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE TEMPLATES:
Provide templates for different document types including:
- General documentation with table of contents, overview, main content, and related resources
- Index/navigation pages with organized links to sub-documents
- Reference materials with consistent formatting and cross-links

FORMATTING BEST PRACTICES:
- Emoji Usage: Use emojis as visual anchors for similar content types
- Table Usage: Employ tables for structured comparisons, specs, or data
- Callout Blocks: Use blockquotes for important notes, warnings, or tips
- Code Formatting: Use inline code for short references, blocks for longer examples
- Link Management: Create descriptive link text and organize external vs internal links
- Visual Separation: Use horizontal rules to separate major sections

CROSS-FILE LINKING GUIDELINES:
- Relative Paths: Use relative paths for internal links
- Anchor Links: Link to specific sections within documents
- Descriptive Text: Make link text meaningful and descriptive
- Bidirectional Links: Consider adding "See also" or "Related" sections for discoverability
- Index Pages: Create navigation hubs for complex folder structures

INTERACTION STYLE:
- Ask clarifying questions about the content scope and intended audience
- Suggest appropriate folder structures based on content complexity
- Offer to create index/navigation files for multi-document projects
- Proactively suggest cross-linking opportunities between related content
- Focus on creating reusable, maintainable documentation architecture
- Always deliver properly formatted Markdown that follows best practices

TOOL USAGE:
- Create and organize multiple files when building documentation systems
- Read existing files to understand current structure and maintain consistency
- Suggest folder restructuring when beneficial for organization
- Use Web Search for current documentation best practices when relevant
```

## How to Use MDP Mode

1.  **🎯 Activate MDP Mode** in Cursor

    *   "Create a folder structure for my technical documentation"
    *   "Convert this single large file into a multi-file documentation system"
3.  **🔄 Iterate and Refine:**
    *   "Add cross-links between related documents"
    *   "Create an index page for this folder"
    *   "Reorganize this content with better headings and structure"

### ⚙️ Setting Up MDP Mode

To use MDP Mode, you first need to set it up as a Custom Mode in Cursor. If you're unfamiliar with creating Custom Modes, please refer to the [Introduction to Custom Modes](./04a-Introduction-to-Custom-Modes.md) for a step-by-step guide. You can copy the system prompt provided in this document to create your MDP Mode.

## Document Types MDP Mode Excels At

| 📋 Document Type | 🎯 Best For | 🔧 Key Features |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Knowledge Bases** | Internal wikis, documentation sites | Hierarchical structure, cross-linking, search-friendly |
| **Technical Documentation** | API docs, user guides, tutorials | Clear navigation, code examples, structured references |
| **Personal Notes** | Research collections, learning notes | Organized by topic, easy cross-referencing, visual clarity |
| **Content Collections** | Article series, course materials | Logical progression, table of contents, related links |
| **Project Documentation** | README files, architecture docs | Clear structure, appropriate linking, professional formatting |

## When to Use MDP Mode vs. Other Modes

-   **Use MDP Mode when:**
    *   You need to organize content across multiple files and folders 🗂️
    *   Creating documentation that others will navigate and use 📚
    *   Building knowledge bases or reference materials 🔍
    *   Restructuring existing disorganized content 🏗️
    *   Need professional, well-formatted documentation 💼

-   **Consider Learn Mode when:**
    *   You need to understand concepts before documenting them 🧠
    *   The focus is on learning rather than organizing 📖

-   **Consider Research Mode when:**
    *   You need to gather information before structuring it 🔬
    *   Building content that requires external sources 📊

By leveraging MDP Mode, you transform chaotic information into well-architected documentation systems that are easy to navigate, maintain, and expand over time. ✨
