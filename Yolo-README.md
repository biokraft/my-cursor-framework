Yo, code-slingers and doc-divas! 🎤 Welcome to the most EXTRAVAGANZA ✨ of best practices, MEGA-RULES that are basically cheat codes 🎮, and workflows so mind-bending 🌀 they'll have you questioning reality! This ain't just a framework; it's your golden ticket 🎟️ to becoming a Cursor GOD/GODDESS 👑, slinging AI like a pro and making your computer basically your intern.
