# Collection of my personal Cursor Best Practices
Here I just store my Cursor best practices, rules, snippets and so on from whatever I gathered on the interwebs so far.

# What to expect

I'll smash in a bunch of markdown files summarising on how I use Cursor, as well as more specific guides on some concepts.

Under `.cursor/rules` you can find a collection of my Cursor rules.

You can pick and choose what you like.
