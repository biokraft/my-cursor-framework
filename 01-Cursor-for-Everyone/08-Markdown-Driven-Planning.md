A powerful way to work in Cursor is to move all of your planning, brainstorming, and note-taking into Markdown files right alongside your code.

## Why Plan in Markdown?

-   **Unified Environment:** No more context-switching between your editor and a notes app.
-   **AI-Powered Ideation:** Use your favorite Custom Modes directly on your plans. The **[MDP Mode](./04-Custom-Modes-Tailoring-Cursor-to-You/04c-Mode-Spotlight-MDP.md)** is especially designed for this workflow.
-   **Version Control for Ideas:** Use Git to track the history of your plans just like you track your code.

## Example Workflow

1.  **Create a `.md` File:** Start a new plan, like `feature-x-plan.md`.
2.  **Activate MDP Mode:** Ask it to create a structured template for you.
3.  **Outline & Draft:** Fill in the template with your ideas, creating checklists and tables as needed.
4.  **Iterate with AI:**
    -   Use **Learn Mode** on concepts you're unsure about.
    -   Use **Research Mode** to find supporting information.
    -   Use **MDP Mode** to keep the structure clean and organized.
5.  **Commit Your Progress:** Regularly save your planning milestones with `git commit`.

This entire guide was built using this exact workflow, demonstrating its power and effectiveness.
