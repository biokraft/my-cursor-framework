# Custom Modes: Tailoring Cursor to Your Specific Needs

Cursor Custom Modes are a powerful feature that allows you to create specialized "personas" or "experts" within the AI, each with its own predefined instructions, context, and even preferred tools. This enables you to quickly switch between different AI behaviors tailored for specific tasks like learning new concepts, explaining complex code, or conducting research.

## What are Custom Modes?

Think of Custom Modes as saved configurations for the Cursor chat. Each mode can have:

-   **A System Prompt:** A set of initial instructions that defines the AI's role, personality, expertise, and how it should behave or respond. This is the core of the customization.
-   **Pre-selected Tools:** You can specify which tools (like Codebase Search, Web Search, File Edits) the mode should have access to or prefer using.
-   **A Dedicated Name:** A recognizable name (e.g., "Learn Mode," "Code Explainer," "Research Assistant") so you can easily switch to it.

## Why Use Custom Modes?

-   **Efficiency:** Instead of typing out long, repetitive instructions for common tasks, you can encapsulate them in a mode and activate it with a click.
-   **Consistency:** Ensure the AI approaches specific tasks in a consistent way every time.
-   **Specialization:** Create AI assistants that are experts in particular domains or workflows (e.g., a mode specifically for writing documentation according to your company's style guide, or a mode for refactoring code according to specific performance principles).
-   **Focus:** Help the AI (and yourself) stay focused on a particular task by limiting its scope or tools.
-   **Ease of Use:** Simplifies complex prompting by abstracting it into an easy-to-select mode.

## How Custom Modes Work (High Level)

1.  **Defining the Mode:** You create a new custom mode through Cursor's interface (often in the settings or a dedicated modes panel).
2.  **Setting the System Prompt:** This is where you give the AI its primary instructions. For example, for a "Learn Mode," you might tell it: "You are an expert tutor. Explain concepts clearly, provide examples, and ask follow-up questions to ensure understanding."
3.  **Configuring Tools (Optional):** You can specify if the mode should have access to all tools, a subset of tools, or if it should primarily use certain tools.
4.  **Saving and Naming:** Give your mode a descriptive name.
5.  **Activating the Mode:** When you want to use it, you select it from your list of custom modes. The AI will then operate under the instructions you defined for that mode.

## Setting Up a Custom Mode (General Steps)

While the exact UI might vary slightly with Cursor versions, the general process is:

1.  **Find the Custom Modes Setting:** Look for an option like "Custom Modes," "Agent Modes," or "Personalities" in Cursor's settings or chat panel.

2.  **Create a New Mode:** There will usually be a button or option to "Create New Mode" or "Add Mode."
3.  **Name Your Mode:** Choose a clear and descriptive name.
4.  **Write the System Prompt:** This is the most crucial part. Carefully craft the instructions that will define this mode's behavior. You can iterate on this prompt over time.
    *   Start with a clear role: "You are a..."
    *   Define its goal or mission.
    *   Specify how it should interact, what kind of output it should produce, and any constraints.
5.  **Configure Tools:** Select the tools that are appropriate for this mode's purpose.
6.  **Save the Mode:** Once configured, save it.

Your new Custom Mode will then be available for you to select and use in your chat sessions.

In the following sections, we'll look at specific examples of useful custom modes like Learn Mode, Explain Mode, and Research Mode.
