# üó∫Ô∏è Exploring the MCP Ecosystem

> **üîë Key Takeaways:**
> 
> - **More Than Just Atlassian:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to connect Cursor to a wide variety of tools, not just Jira and Confluence.
> - **Community-Driven:** The ecosystem is growing, with connectors being built by Cursor, third-party developers, and the open-source community.
> - **Discover New Tools:** Key places to find new MCP servers are the official Cursor documentation, community forums, and curated lists like `mcp.so`.
> - **Future is Connected:** The goal of MCP is to make Cursor a central hub that can interact with your entire digital workspace.

While the Atlassian and `dbhub` integrations are powerful, the vision for MCP is much bigger. The goal is to connect Cursor to as many parts of your digital workspace as possible.

## ‚ú® The Potential of MCP

Imagine Cursor seamlessly interacting with:

-   **Note-Taking Apps:** Notion, Obsidian, etc.
-   **Design Tools:** Figma, for fetching component info.
-   **Monitoring Tools:** Grafana, for querying dashboard data.
-   **Communication Tools:** Slack or Teams, for searching relevant discussions.

## üìç Where to Find New MCP Connectors

The ecosystem is constantly growing. Here are the best places to look for new MCP servers:

-   **Official Cursor Docs:** The first place to check for officially supported integrations.
-   **Cursor's In-App Settings:** The MCP panel in settings will show available connectors.
-   **Community Channels:** The Cursor Discord and forums are great for announcements.
-   **Curated Lists:**
    -   **[mcp.so](https://mcp.so/):** A directory of open-source MCP servers.
    -   **[PulseMCP](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers):** A comprehensive directory, often with community ratings.
    -   **[GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers):** A repository of reference implementations.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers: The MCP Inspector

If you're building or debugging your own MCP server, the **MCP Inspector** is an essential tool. It's an interactive utility for testing and inspecting server implementations.

You can run it directly via `npx`:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command>
```
For more details, see the [official MCP Inspector documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).
