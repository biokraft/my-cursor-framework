# üß† Choosing Your AI Model

> **üîë Key Takeaways:**
> 
> - **"Auto" is a Great Default:** If you're unsure, use the "auto" model selection. It intelligently picks the right model for the job.
> - **Match the Model to the Task:** Use powerful "thinking" models for complex problems and faster models for quick, iterative tasks.
> - **Top "Thinkers":** For deep reasoning, prefer models like `claude-4-sonnet` or `gemini-2.5-pro`.
> - **Top "Fast" Models:** For speed and efficiency, prefer models like `claude-4-opus` or `gpt-4.1`.
> - **Avoid "MAX" Settings:** Using the highest-intensity setting drains your quota quickly with diminishing returns.

Cursor offers access to various AI models, each with unique strengths. Choosing the right one is like picking the right specialist for a task‚Äîit's key to maximizing your productivity.

## ü§î Key Considerations When Choosing

-   **Complexity:** How difficult is the task? A simple code change needs a different model than designing a new system architecture.
-   **Speed vs. Intelligence:** The most powerful models are often slower. Balance your need for a quick answer with the depth of thought required.
-   **Cost:** On paid plans, different models have different usage costs.

## üöÄ Recommended Models

Here are the top recommendations based on common use cases.

### üß† For Complex Reasoning & Generation ("Thinkers")

Use these models for tasks requiring deep understanding, creativity, and detailed output.

-   **Anthropic Sonnet/Opus (latest):** Strong for deep problem-solving.
-   **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Powerful reasoning capabilities.
-   **OpenAI (latest GPT-5):** Solid all-rounders.

### ‚ö° For Quick Assistance & Iteration ("Fast Models")

Use these models when you need rapid responses for less complex tasks.

-   **Anthropic Sonnet/Haiku (current fast tier):** Balanced quality/speed.
-   **OpenAI GPT-4.1 or successor fast models:** All-rounder for daily tasks.

## üí° How Cursor Uses Different Models

It's helpful to know that Cursor may use different models for different internal tasks.

-   **Chat & Generation:** You typically choose the model for these interactions.
-   **Applying Edits & Other Tasks:** Cursor often uses smaller, faster models for "non-thinking" tasks like applying a diff or formatting code. This provides a smoother experience without wasting the power of a "thinking" model.
