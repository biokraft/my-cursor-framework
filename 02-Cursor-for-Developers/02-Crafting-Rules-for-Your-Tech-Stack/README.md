# 🛠️ Crafting Rules for Your Tech Stack

> **🔑 Key Takeaways:**
>
> - **Enforce Consistency:** Create rules that are specific to your tech stack (e.g., Python/FastAPI, React/TypeScript) to enforce coding standards and architectural patterns.
> - **Automate Best Practices:** Codify library-specific best practices directly into rules, ensuring the AI generates code that follows your team's conventions.
> - **Bootstrap from Documentation:** Learn how to auto-generate a base set of rules by pointing Cursor's AI at the official documentation for your framework or library.
