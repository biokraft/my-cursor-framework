> **üîë Key Takeaways:**
>
> - **üéØ For Everyone:** Start with [Part 1](./01-Cursor-for-Everyone/) to master core concepts like Rules, Custom Modes, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
> - **üíª For Developers:** Dive into [Part 2](./02-Cursor-for-Developers/) for advanced workflows, including tech-specific rules and the `SpecsForge` framework for spec-driven development, followed by smart implementation choices.
> - **üöÄ Core Philosophy:** This guide emphasizes that providing clear, relevant context is the "golden rule" for getting the most out of Cursor.
> - **‚ö° Smart Workflow Decisions:** Learn when to use **TDV mode** for complex features vs **Stock Agent + "Make a todo list"** for rapid scaffolding and setup tasks.
> - **üõ†Ô∏è Actionable Resources:** The repository includes a rich set of [reusable rules](./.cursor/rules/) and practical examples to accelerate your learning.

Welcome to this personal collection of best practices, rules, and workflows designed to maximize your productivity with Cursor. This framework aims to help everyone, from Product Managers to Developers, harness the full potential of AI-assisted coding and documentation.

**üí° Pro Tip for Everyone (Especially Non-Developers):** One of the most impactful ways to boost your productivity with Cursor is through [Markdown-Driven Planning & Brainstorming](./01-Cursor-for-Everyone/08-Markdown-Driven-Planning.md). It's a simple yet powerful technique to manage knowledge and projects, and you'll find it covered in Part 1.

This repository is structured to guide you through understanding core Cursor concepts and then diving into advanced development workflows.

> Note: Cursor evolves quickly. Recent platform capabilities include **Background Agent** (with a dedicated panel and Slack launch), **BugBot** for PR reviews, **Memories**, **Jupyter Notebook editing**, **richer chat rendering** (Mermaid, tables), and improvements across settings, indexing, and dashboards. See the official changelog for details.

### üíª Part 2: [Cursor for Developers](./02-Cursor-for-Developers/README.md)

This section delves into advanced techniques and workflows tailored for developers. It covers topics like building tech-stack specific rules, the `SpecsForge` framework for planning, the `TDV` mode for implementation, and efficient debugging strategies. While aimed at developers, Product Managers and technical leads might also find these insights valuable.

## ‚ú® Featured Workflow in Action: The SpecsForge Framework & TDV Mode

See the `SpecsForge` framework and `TDV` mode in action! This video gives a practical look at how to turn a high-level idea into a detailed specification (`SpecsForge`) and then into well-tested code (`TDV`). The footage is from my open-source CLI tool, [`automake`](https://github.com/biokraft/auto-make), an AI-native shell that turns natural language into actions.

[![Watch the SpecsForge Workflow Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3mSPPsbOkyU/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3mSPPsbOkyU)

> This is a core concept from [Part 2: Cursor for Developers](./02-Cursor-for-Developers/03-The-SpecsForge-Framework.md) and demonstrates a powerful, spec-driven development workflow that is followed up by test-driven implementation.

## üèÅ Getting Started

1.  Explore **Part 1** to build a solid foundation in Cursor's core functionalities.
2.  If you're a developer, proceed to **Part 2** to learn about my specific coding workflows, including the `SpecsForge` framework and `TDV` mode.
3.  Adapt and adopt what works for you! This is a living guide, and I encourage you to tailor these practices to your own needs.

**Hint:** Interested to see how to have fun with Cursor? Try the [Yolo mode](./01-Cursor-for-Everyone/04-Custom-Modes-Tailoring-Cursor-to-You/04e-Mode-Spotlight-Yolo.md)! Here is what this can result in: [Yolo README](./Yolo-README.md).

## üìú My Standard Cursor Rules

I recommend always starting with these foundational rules in your `.cursor/rules` directory:

-   [`00-cursor-rules.md`](./.cursor/rules/00-cursor-rules.md): Defines the general structure and guidelines for your cursor rules.
-   [`01-mdc-guidelines.md`](./.cursor/rules/01-mdc-guidelines.md): Provides specific instructions for working with `.mdc` (Markdown Custom) rule files.

Dive into the `.cursor/rules` directory in this repository to find my collection of reusable rules. Feel free to pick and choose what you need!
