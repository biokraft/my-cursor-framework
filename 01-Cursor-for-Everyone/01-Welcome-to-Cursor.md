# Welcome to Cursor: Your AI-Powered Partner

Cursor is more than just a code editor; it's an integrated development environment (IDE) designed from the ground up to work seamlessly with Artificial Intelligence. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a product manager outlining specs, a technical writer crafting documentation, or a student learning to code, Cursor aims to augment your abilities and streamline your workflows.

## What Can Cursor Do for You?

At its core, Cursor provides a familiar code editing experience but supercharges it with AI capabilities. Here are some of the key things you can do:

-   **AI-Assisted Code Generation & Editing:** Ask Cursor to write new code, refactor existing functions, add comments, fix bugs, and much more, all by describing what you need in natural language.
-   **Chat with Your Codebase:** Have interactive conversations about your project. Ask questions, get explanations of complex code sections, and explore different implementation approaches.
-   **Intelligent Context Awareness:** Cursor excels at understanding the context of your project. By using `@` mentions for files and symbols, leveraging the `@Docs` feature with your documentation, and integrating with tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), you provide rich context to the AI. Furthermore, Cursor can proactively use its web search capabilities when you ask it to look up information online or simply paste a URL into the chat, ensuring its responses are informed by the most current information available.
-   **Customizable Workflows:** Through Cursor Rules and Custom Modes, you can tailor the AI's behavior and create specialized assistants for specific tasks or projects.
-   **Documentation and Research:** Use Cursor to summarize information, draft documentation, research topics, and connect to knowledge bases like Confluence.
-   **Project Management Integration:** Connect to tools like Jira to get information about issues, update tickets, and bring project context directly into your development environment.

## Who is This Guide For?

This guide is structured to be beneficial for a wide audience:

-   **Product Managers & Technical Leads:** Learn how to use Cursor for better specification drafting, documentation, research, and interacting with project management tools.
-   **Developers (All Levels):** Discover how to accelerate your coding, debugging, and learning processes.
-   **Technical Writers:** See how Cursor can assist in generating and maintaining documentation.

## Navigating This Guide

This guide is split into two main parts:

1.  **[Cursor for Everyone](../README.md#part-1-cursor-for-everyone):** Covers the foundational concepts and features applicable to all users.
2.  **[Cursor for Developers](../README.md#part-2-cursor-for-developers):** Dives into more advanced, code-centric workflows and my `SpecsForge` framework.

I recommend starting with "Part 1" to get a solid understanding of Cursor's capabilities. Developers can then proceed to "Part 2" for more specialized techniques.
