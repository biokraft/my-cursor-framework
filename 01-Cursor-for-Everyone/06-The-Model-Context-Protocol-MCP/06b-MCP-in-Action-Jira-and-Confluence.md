# ü§ù MCP in Action: Jira & Confluence

> **üîë Key Takeaways:**
> 
> - **Bring Project Management to Your IDE:** Connect Cursor to Jira and Confluence to pull in issue details and documentation pages as context.
> - **Use Natural Language:** Interact by asking questions like "What are the details for ticket PROJ-123?" or "Find the Confluence page about our API."
> - **Setup Involves API Tokens:** You'll need to generate API tokens from your Atlassian account and add them to Cursor's MCP configuration.
> - **Run via Docker:** The easiest way to run the Atlassian MCP server is via Docker, managed directly by Cursor's MCP settings.

Let's see how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) works with two of the most common development tools: Jira and Confluence.

##  Jira Integration

Integrating Jira allows you to seamlessly pull issue information into your AI workflows.

### Common Use Cases
-   **Get Issue Details:** Quickly fetch the summary, description, and status of a ticket.
-   **Context for Coding:** Give the AI (and yourself) full context on a feature or bug by referencing the Jira ticket.
-   **Add Comments:** Ask Cursor to add a progress comment back to the ticket.

### Example Interactions
-   **Natural Language:**
    -   "What are the details for Jira ticket PROJ-123?"
    -   "Search Jira for open bugs assigned to me."
    -   "Add a comment to PROJ-123 saying 'I'm starting work on this now.'"
-   **Specific Tool Commands:**
    -   `@jira get_issue(issue_key='PROJ-123')`
    -   `@jira add_comment(issue_key='PROJ-123', comment='Done.')`

## üìö Confluence Integration

Connecting to Confluence allows Cursor to tap into your team's knowledge base.

### Common Use Cases
-   **Search for Documentation:** Find relevant technical specs, meeting notes, or user guides.
-   **Get Page Content:** Retrieve the content of a specific page to use as context for the AI.
-   **Answer Questions:** Ask questions that can be answered by information stored in your Confluence space.

### Example Interactions
-   **Natural Language:**
    -   "Find the Confluence page about our deployment process."
    *   "Summarize the Confluence page with ID 123456789."
-   **Specific Tool Commands:**
    -   `@confluence search(query='title~"Release Process"')`
    -   `@confluence get_page(page_id='123456789')`

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup Guide

Here's a simplified guide to get you started. This assumes you are running the `mcp-atlassian` server via Docker, which is the recommended method.

**1. Get Your Atlassian API Tokens:**
   - **Jira:** Go to `id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens` and create a new API token. Save the token securely.
   - **Confluence:** The process is similar; you'll need to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) from your Confluence settings.

**2. Install Docker Desktop:**
   - If you don't have it already, download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

**3. Configure MCP in Cursor:**
   - In Cursor Settings, go to **MCP** and click **"Add new global MCP Server"**.
   - This opens an `mcp.json` file. Paste in the configuration below.
   - **Fill in the placeholders** in the `env` block with your actual URLs, username, and the tokens you just created.

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
      "mcp-atlassian": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run", "-i", "--rm",
          "-e", "CONFLUENCE_URL",
          "-e", "CONFLUENCE_USERNAME",
          "-e", "CONFLUENCE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
          "-e", "JIRA_URL",
          "-e", "JIRA_USERNAME",
          "-e", "JIRA_API_TOKEN",
          "-e", "READ_ONLY_MODE=true",
          "ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest"
        ],
        "env": {
          "CONFLUENCE_URL": "https://your-company.atlassian.net/wiki",
          "CONFLUENCE_USERNAME": "your.email@company.com",
          "CONFLUENCE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_CONFLUENCE_PAT_HERE",
          "JIRA_URL": "https://your-company.atlassian.net",
          "JIRA_USERNAME": "your.email@company.com",
          "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_JIRA_API_TOKEN_HERE",
          "READ_ONLY_MODE": "true"
        },
        "description": "Atlassian MCP Server (Jira & Confluence)",
        "timeoutSeconds": 60
      }
    }
  }
```

**4. Save and Test:**
   - Save the `mcp.json` file.
   - The server entry should appear in your MCP settings with a green status indicator.
   - Test it in the chat: "Get details for Jira ticket PROJ-123".

-   **Analyze & Comment:** Ask Cursor to analyze the ticket and suggest a comment.
