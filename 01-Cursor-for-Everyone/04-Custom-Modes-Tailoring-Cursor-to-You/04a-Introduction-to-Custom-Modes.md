Cursor Custom Modes allow you to create specialized "personas" or "experts" within the AI. This lets you quickly switch between different AI behaviors tailored for specific tasks, like learning a new concept or drafting documentation.

## ‚ú® Why Use Custom Modes?

-   **Efficiency:** Instead of re-typing long instructions for common tasks, activate a mode with one click.
-   **Consistency:** Ensure the AI approaches specific tasks in a consistent way every time.
-   **Specialization:** Create expert AI assistants for different domains (e.g., a "Documentation Writer" mode or a "Code Refactoring" mode).
-   **Focus:** Help the AI stay on task by defining its scope and available tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Up a Custom Mode

The process is straightforward and handled through Cursor's UI.

1.  **Navigate to Custom Modes:** Find the "Custom Modes" or "Agent Modes" section in Cursor's settings.

3.  **Configure the Mode:**
    *   **Name:** Give it a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Learn Mode").
    *   **System Prompt:** This is the most important part. Write instructions that define the mode's behavior. Start with a clear role, like "You are an expert tutor..."
    *   **Tools:** Select which tools (like Web Search or File Edits) the mode should have access to.

4.  **Save and Activate:** Save the mode, and it will be available to select in your chat panel.

    *   Once saved, your new mode will appear in the chat input's model selector.

In the following sections, we'll explore concrete examples of useful custom modes.
