# üõ†Ô∏è Crafting Rules for Your Tech Stack

> **üîë Key Takeaways:**
>
> - **Enforce Consistency:** Create rules that are specific to your tech stack (e.g., Python/FastAPI, React/TypeScript) to enforce coding standards and architectural patterns.
> - **Automate Best Practices:** Codify library-specific best practices directly into rules, ensuring the AI generates code that follows your team's conventions.
> - **Bootstrap from Documentation:** Learn how to auto-generate a base set of rules by pointing Cursor's AI at the official documentation for your framework or library.

Welcome! While "Part 1" covered the basics of Rules, this section dives into creating rules specifically for a developer's workflow. Tailoring rules to your programming languages, frameworks, and libraries is how you unlock massive productivity gains and enforce project-wide consistency.
